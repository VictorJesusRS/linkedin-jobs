    <h1>Project abandoned due to a better solucion to the bad linkedin search</h1>

        <p> 
            To make searching work properly you need to put words between double quotes ("").
            So "Java" will search for that word. For multiple words use the operators AND and OR,
            like this: "Java" OR "Spring Boot", "Java" Or "React Native"
        </p>
        <p>
            And thats it!
