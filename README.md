<div>
    <h2>Project abandoned due to a better solucion to the bad linkedin search</h2>
    <div>
        <p> 
            To make searching work properly you need to <strong> put words between double quotes ("") </strong>.
            So "Java" will search for that word. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>For multiple words use the operators AND and OR,</strong>
            like this: "Java" OR "Spring Boot", "Java" Or "React Native"
        </p>
        <p>
            And thats it!
        </p>
